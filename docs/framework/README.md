# Chicago SMB Market Radar ‚Äî BI 0‚Üí1 Framework Strategic Plan

## Executive Summary

This document maps the current Chicago SMB Market Radar project to the BI 0‚Üí1 Framework, providing a comprehensive view of what's been built, what's working, and the strategic roadmap for the remaining steps.

## Current Project State Analysis

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Scope & Strategy ‚Äî COMPLETED

**Business Challenge Identified:**
- Chicago's economic development team needs real-time visibility into small business activity
- Data scattered across multiple city departments with quarterly manual reports
- No real-time insights or neighborhood-level granularity

**Stakeholder Mapping:**
- **Primary Users:** Economic Development Director, Policy Analysts, Mayor's Office
- **Secondary Users:** Community Organizations, Business Associations, Academic Researchers

**Success Metrics Defined:**
- 90% reduction in report preparation time
- Daily data freshness (vs quarterly)
- 5+ policy decisions informed by dashboard

**Technical Scope (MVP):**
- ‚úÖ Chicago Open Data Portal integration
- ‚úÖ Daily automated data refresh capability
- ‚úÖ Google Sheets as data warehouse
- ‚úÖ 3 core datasets: Business Licenses, Building Permits, CTA Boardings
- ‚úÖ Neighborhood-level granularity (Community Areas)

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Data Ingestion ‚Äî COMPLETED

**Data Sources Identified:**
- **Business Licenses** (`r5kz-chrr`): 200K+ active licenses, updated daily
- **Building Permits** (`ydr8-5enu`): Construction and renovation permits
- **CTA Boardings** (`6iiy-9s97`): Public transit usage patterns

**API Integration Strategy:**
- ‚úÖ Socrata Open Data API (SODA) implementation
- ‚úÖ Robust error handling and retry logic
- ‚úÖ Pagination support for large datasets
- ‚úÖ Data validation and schema checking

**Current Implementation:**
```python
# Key components in src/socrata.py
class SocrataClient:
    - Handles pagination automatically
    - Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
    - Supports complex filtering and field selection
    - Logs all API interactions for debugging
```

**Data Quality Assessment:**
- ‚úÖ Field mapping validation
- ‚úÖ Data type consistency checks
- ‚úÖ Missing field detection
- ‚úÖ API response validation

### üîÑ Step 3: Transform & Model ‚Äî PARTIALLY COMPLETED

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ Raw data extraction and storage
- ‚úÖ Basic data flattening (location data)
- ‚úÖ Google Sheets integration for data warehouse
- ‚ùå **MISSING:** Business logic transformations
- ‚ùå **MISSING:** Time-series aggregations
- ‚ùå **MISSING:** Business metrics calculations

**What's Working:**
```python
# Data extraction with comprehensive field selection
def fetch_licenses(client, cfg, days_lookback: int):
    # Extracts 20+ fields including business details, location, dates
    # Filters for new license issues only
    # Saves raw data to JSON files
    # Returns pandas DataFrame
```

**What's Missing:**
- Weekly aggregations by community area
- Business category mapping and normalization
- Trend analysis (WoW, momentum indices)
- Baseline calculations (13-week rolling averages)
- Summary metrics generation

**Business Logic Framework (Designed but not implemented):**
```python
# Planned transformations in src/transform.py
def daily_to_weekly(df, date_col, group_cols, value_col):
    # Convert daily data to weekly aggregations

def add_baselines(df, group_cols, value_col, baseline_weeks=13):
    # Calculate rolling averages and momentum indices

def apply_category_map(df, mapping_df, desc_col, out_col="bucket"):
    # Map license descriptions to business categories
```

### ‚ùå Step 4: Load & Validate ‚Äî NOT STARTED

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ Data loaded to Google Sheets
- ‚ùå **MISSING:** Data validation framework
- ‚ùå **MISSING:** Data quality monitoring
- ‚ùå **MISSING:** Automated testing

**Planned Implementation:**
- Great Expectations for data validation
- Automated data quality checks
- Schema validation
- Business rule validation

### ‚ùå Step 5: Visualize & Report ‚Äî NOT STARTED

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ Basic markdown report generation
- ‚ùå **MISSING:** Interactive dashboard
- ‚ùå **MISSING:** Executive summary metrics
- ‚ùå **MISSING:** Trend visualizations

**Planned Implementation:**
- Looker Studio dashboard
- Automated report generation
- Executive KPI tracking
- Neighborhood-level drill-downs

### ‚ùå Step 6: Automate & Scale ‚Äî NOT STARTED

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ Manual execution capability
- ‚ùå **MISSING:** Scheduled automation
- ‚ùå **MISSING:** Error handling and alerting
- ‚ùå **MISSING:** Performance monitoring
